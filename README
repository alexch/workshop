Using showoff to generate the workshop slides
    sudo gem install showoff
    showoff serve
   slidedown workshop.md > workshop.html
   open workshop.html

use arrow keys to navigate slides


If you are creating a new set of slides, you would create "workshop.md" by writing markdown, see other .md files in the root directory for example

If you want to edit slides, change one of the .md files and regenerate the .html and check both in

to generate notes (html without the !SLIDES notation)
   ./makenotes workshop.md workshop-notes.html

not really print-able, but a good starting point for handouts (which I then copy into a pretty editor, format and print), someday would be nice to CSS/PDF or something to avoid the manual step

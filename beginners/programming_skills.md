# Programming Skills

This presentation covers the basic skills required to be a programmer...

 ...that **don't** involve actually writing code.

# Files and Directories

* The House/Rooms/Drawers Metaphor
  * directories store files and keep everything in your ‘house’ organized

# The Command Line

    ls
    cd
    pwd
    echo
    touch
    cat
    mv
    cp
    rm

# Special Directories

* Current directory 
  * `.` ("dot")
* Parent directory
  * `..` ("dot dot")
* Home directory
  * `~` ("tilde")

# More about directories

* Explain where home and root are located in relation to all directories.
* Explain difference between absolute paths (starting with a /) and relative paths.

# Text Editing

* text editor vs. word processor
  * similarities and differences
* Have group open editor, create and save file with explanation of how and where files are stored.
  * after change, go to command line and `cat` the file to see 
* Explain file extensions and file types. 
  * File types tell the editor how to color the special words in each language. 
* Explain difference between the buffer (in the editor’s memory) and the file (stored on disk).  
  * Emphasize the importance of saving the buffer to a file before trying to run it with ruby.
  * "Save" makes things unsafe

# Compilers, Interpreters and Programming Languages

* Use metaphor of programming language as an agreed set of rules about syntax for writing source code that is sent to the interpreter and translated into byte code.
* Explain that byte code is the binary that machines understand and use for executing instructions.
* Use metaphor that CPU is like a guy in a factory executing commands that it is handled, and the source code are those instructions.
* Explain differences between compiled vs. dynamic languages.
* Tie everything together by explaining that source code are instructions that are translated into language that machines understand and can execute.

# Memory, CPU, Hard Disk

* Very briefly explain how a computer works and all the moving parts (literally) starting with hard drive, memory, and CPU.
* Give the group basic understanding of where the source code is stored and how and where it is executed.

# Operating System

* The OS is a program that runs other programs
  * the term "multitasking" actually started with computers and migrated to common usage
* It also helps programs communicate with hardware (video, memory, disk, network...)

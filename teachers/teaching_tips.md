Following is some advice about how to teach a Railsbridge Open Workshop

We'll also ask you to share your experiences teaching (or TA'ing) with the room

.notes Hi! These are some notes for the teacher of teachers. :-)

# Schedule

* Everybody comes together for opening session
* Split into smaller groups for morning and afternoon teaching sessions
  * This can be chaotic so make sure your students can find you
* Everyone back together for closing session
  * Make sure your students know a closing session is coming so they don't run off

<!SLIDE bullets>
# Stress != Learning

* Before anyone touches a keyboard, set up a welcoming classroom environment.
* smile! :):):)
* make eye contact

<!SLIDE bullets>
# Never grab someone's keyboard

* This can be offputting and even scary
* Instead, ask "Do you mind if I type?" or "May I show you what I mean?"

<!SLIDE bullets>
# Introductions & Icebreakers

* Give people a chance to get to know each other in a casual way.
* Go around the table and ask people to share something about themselves    
  * name
  * experience or profession
  * why are you here? 
    * (better than "what do you want to get out of this?" for beginners)
* Include something weird or meaningless (to build confidence in speaking out loud)
  * what's your least favorite ice cream flavor?
  * what one weird thing are you good at?
* If time, you can brainstorm/discussion to get everyone talking

# Tell your own story

tell your story. tell why you like programming and teaching. beware of bragging. tell why you care! why are you getting up on saturday morning to come in here.

# Ground Rules

* People may have missed these during the opening session, so briefly cover

  * Schedule
  * What to expect from the day
  * When is lunch?
  * Where is the bathroom?
  * Questions are always welcome. Even dumb ones.

# Questions are good

* Get people comfortable asking questions

* Ask for questions. even dumb ones. 
  * Later in the workshop, anticipate dumb questions if possible)

  * barrier to asking questions: vocabulary! they don’t know what methods are, etc.

* respond positively to the first  few questions

  * i’m glad you said that
  * what an interesting question
  * great question
  * i’ve wondered that myself

# Slow down

Many teachers talk too fast. Make sure to pace yourself.

* wait much longer than you feel is comfortable for questions/comments-- leave a space for them to ask questions
* Also make sure to wait for an answer after you ask a question
  * Count to ten (silently)
  * chances are, someone else will fill the void
* Ask about pacing. Ask for feedback.
* emphasize: this is a learning process 

* talk sssssslllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyyyyyy. you will be talking to fast if you’re excited/nervous 
* get the students talking to each other

* when a question is posed, let another student answer it first
* lay this expectation out explicitly at the beginning that they should try to answer each other’s questions.

# General tips


* Don't think about what you're doing to do in the class, think about what they're going to do.

# How do you check their understanding? 

* Some things that don't work:  
  * “Stop me if you don’t understand.”  (because they’ll be too shy) 
  * “Do you get it?” (because it’s too easy to say yes when the answer is no) 

* ask them a question about the material. but how to do this without putting them on the spot?
* ask questions about something that has already been built on top of. Spiral.
* KEEP AN EYE ON BODY LANGUAGE/FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
  * ‘i see some confusion. let’s get a question.’
* pairing off and discussing/explaining
* ask a less binary question to check understanding
  * how would you do ___
  * if i want to do this, what would i do?

* teach basic concept, then ask them to apply it
* explain while loops, have them build one
* pair them off and debug
* ok to ask the same question twice with slightly different variables
* don’t let the ringer dictate the pace 
* tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them

# How to effectively use TA’s

* have them debug/look at students’ computer screens
* have them do the curriculum too
  * to have them do it a little head
  * will find snags before students
  * to answer questions on the side / help debug
* pair them with the n00best/most shy students
* give them ownership in the beginning-- set up team teaching environment
  * have a meeting before to set up this environment
* feel free to go on tangents

# Teaching Programming

How would you explain these concepts to a total beginner?

*  What is a variable?
*  What is the difference between a string and a number?
*  What is a comment?
*  What is a function? 

Ruby sometimes makes things magical by doing things for you. But this magic obscures the underlying patterns for beginners. Don’t get into optional parameters. If something can be left out in a function call, DON’T leave it out. 

Before you have them do anything, first explain the big picture of what they’re about to do. E.G.: before typing in the command to deploy to heroku, explain the difference between localhost and heroku.  

Diagrams are helpful! Draw how all the pieces connect together.

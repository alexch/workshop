# Teacher Training

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# What are we doing here?
* Over the next two hours, we will share advice about how to teach a Railsbridge Open Workshop.
* This will be a conversation, not a lecture. 
  * You will share your experiences teaching (or TA'ing) with the room
  * (yes, this is a sneaky way of modeling how you should teach your class)

<!SLIDE bullets>
# Who are you?

* Who has taught before?
* Who has TA'd before?
* Why are you here?

<!SLIDE bullets>
# Who am I?
.notes Tell the class about yourself, your experience, your motivation.

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# What is the goal of the Railsbridge Open Workshop?

* Teaching Ruby on Rails?
  * yes, but...
* Teaching Programming?
  * yes, but...
* Teaching that code is fun?
  * Yes!

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Stress vs. Learning
* Before anyone touches a keyboard, set up a welcoming classroom environment.

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# How to set up a welcoming classroom environment?

* smile! :):):)
* make eye contact
* ...?

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Introductions & Icebreakers

* Give people a chance to get to know each other in a casual way.
* Go around the table and ask people to share something about themselves    
  * name
  * experience or profession
  * why are you here? 
    * (better than "what do you want to get out of this?" for beginners)

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# More Icebreakers
* Include something weird or meaningless (to build confidence in speaking out loud)
  * what's your least favorite ice cream flavor?
  * what one weird thing are you good at?
* If time, you can brainstorm/discuss to get everyone talking

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# How to introduce yourself to the class?
* As a teacher or TA... 
  * tell your story
  * tell why you like programming and teaching. 
  * beware of bragging. 
  * tell why you care! Why are you getting up on saturday morning to come in here?

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# What else to cover before starting class?
* Ground Rules
* Schedule
* Installation
* Logistics
* Web Resources

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# Ground Rules
 People may have missed these during the opening session, so briefly cover...

  * Questions are always welcome. Even dumb ones.
  * Schedule
  * What to expect from the day?
  * Where is the bathroom?
  * When is lunch?
  * Where is the afterparty?

<!SLIDE bullets>
# Schedule

* Everybody comes together for opening session
* Split into smaller groups for morning and afternoon teaching sessions
  * This can be chaotic so make sure your students can find you
* Everyone back together for closing session
  * Make sure your students know a closing session is coming so they don't run off

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# What if a student has install trouble?
* Do **not** stop teaching to debug it
* Ask the student to pair up with her neighbor until the next break
* Ask a TA to take a look at it when they get a chance

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Web Resources
You should be aware of these, even if you don't tell the students all of them right away.

* devchix wiki
* workshop github repo (slides and diagrams)
* diagrams:
  * REST
  * MVC
* separate curricula for noobies and post-noobies

<!SLIDE subsection>
# General Teaching Advice

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Questions are good
* Get people comfortable asking questions
* Ask for questions (even dumb ones)
  * Later in the workshop, anticipate questions if possible
* when a question is posed, let another student answer it first
  * lay this expectation out explicitly at the beginning that they should try to answer each other’s questions
  
<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Why might students *not* ask questions? 
  * Vocabulary (they don’t know what methods are, etc.)
  * Insecurity
  * ...?

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# How should the teacher respond to the first  few questions?
* Positively!
  * i’m glad you said that
  * what an interesting question
  * great question
  * i’ve wondered that myself

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# Pacing
* Slow down!
  * Many teachers talk too fast. Make sure to pace yourself.
* wait much longer than you feel is comfortable for questions/comments
  * leave a space for them to ask questions
* Also make sure to wait for an answer after you ask a question
  * Count to ten (silently)
  * chances are, someone else will fill the void

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# Pacing (cont.)
* Ask about pacing. Ask for feedback.
* emphasize: this is a learning process 
* if you’re excited/nervous, you will be talking too fast
* talk sssssslllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyyyyyy. 
* get the students talking to each other

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# What if a student feels the class is going too slow?
* Talk to her privately
* Suggest moving up from noob to post-noob
* Suggest field promotion to TA

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# Pair programming -- yea or nay?
* Pros?
* Cons?

<!SLIDE bullets>
# How to work one-on-one with students?
* Never grab someone's keyboard
  * This can be offputting and even scary
  * Instead, ask "Do you mind if I type?" or just "May I?"
* How else...?

<!SLIDE bullets incremental>
# More general teaching tips
* Don't think about what you're doing to do in the class, think about what they're going to do. 
* tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them
* ...?

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# How do you check their understanding? 

* Some things that don't work:  
  * “Stop me if you don’t understand.”  (because they’ll be too shy) 
  * “Do you get it?” (because it’s too easy to say yes when the answer is no) 

* ask them a question about the material. but how to do this without putting them on the spot?
* ask questions about something that has already been built on top of. Spiral.

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# How do you check their understanding? (more) 
* keep an eye on body language/facial expressions
  * ‘i see some confusion. let’s get a question.’
* pairing off and discussing/explaining
* ask a less binary question to check understanding
  * how would you do ___
  * if i want to do this, what would i do?

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# How do you check their understanding? (more) 
* teach basic concept, then ask them to apply it
* explain while loops, have them build one
* pair them off and debug
* ok to ask the same question twice with slightly different variables
* don’t let the ringer dictate the pace  

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# How to effectively use TA’s

* have them debug/look at students’ computer screens
* have them do the curriculum too
  * to have them do it a little head
  * will find snags before students
  * to answer questions on the side / help debug
* pair them with the n00best/most shy students
* give them ownership in the beginning-- set up team teaching environment
  * have a meeting before to set up this environment
* feel free to go on tangents 
 
<!SLIDE subsection>
# Teaching Programming

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# How would you explain these concepts to a total beginner?

*  What is a variable?
*  What is the difference between a string and a number?
*  What is a comment?
*  What is a function? 

<!SLIDE smbullets incremental>
# More advice on teaching programming

* Ruby sometimes makes things magical by doing things for you. But this magic obscures the underlying patterns for beginners. Don’t get into optional parameters. If something can be left out in a function call, DON’T leave it out. 
* Before you have them do anything, first explain the big picture of what they’re about to do. 
  * E.G.: before typing in the command to deploy to heroku, explain the difference between localhost and heroku.
* Diagrams are helpful! Draw how all the pieces connect together.

<!SLIDE subsection>
# Now You Do It
* It's time to split up into smaller groups and go through all the materials
* Together with a partner (or two or three), do the whole workshop
* Make note of problems or questions so we can discuss them at the end

# See you next weekend!
And thanks for volunteering!
